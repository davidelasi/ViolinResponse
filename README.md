# Violin system identification estimation experiments

The general idea here is to create a nonlinear acoustic model of a violin with an attached voice-coil exciter. 

I am starting with a room-response technique of Farina, which was implemented by @baranovmv. I hope to add a binary stochastic method of determining the impulse response as opposed to the  swept-sine technique described in Farina's work.
